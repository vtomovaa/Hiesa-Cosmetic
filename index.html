                    A 12-week, single-centre, clinical study conducted on 77 females with Fitzpatrick type I-VI, ages
                    35-75,

                    and
                    dull complexion. Hiesa Cosmetic was used twice daily over the face, neck, and chest in
                    conjunction with a sunscreen, for 12 weeks. Efficacy and tolerance evaluations were conducted at
                    baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

                            <br>
                            Many factors contribute to skin ageing, like free radicals, oxidative stressors, UV
                            radiation, pollution and others.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Added to this is the glycation process, in which sugar molecules bind to the structural skin
                            proteins collagen and elastin. This process turns the previously flexible proteins brittle,
                            transforming them into Hiesa Cosmetic‚Äîadvanced glycation end-products. The newly-glycated
                            collagen
                            loses its critical regenerative ability and the skin becomes weaker as the proteins aren't
                            broken down to be replaced. This speeds up both the process and visibility of signs of
                            ageing, including wrinkles and laxity.

                        Endproduct. These are the result of a process called glycation, when skin proteins like collagen
                        are bound by sugar molecules (glycated) and degraded, resulting in a decline in collagen
                        production. SkinCeuticals Hiesa Cosmetic products help target the signs of ageing caused by

                        There's no specific age when anti-ageing products such as Hiesa Cosmetic should be

                        early as possible to help reduce or prevent premature ageing and early signs of ageing. Ideally,
                        anti-ageing products such as this anti-wrinkle cream can be incorporated in your skincare
                        routines from your early to mid-20s.
